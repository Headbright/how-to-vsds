# Publish using LDES Server

Once entities are available in the formed of versioned linked data objects, they can be published as an LDES Stream using a component called [LDES Server](https://informatievlaanderen.github.io/VSDS-Tech-Docs/introduction/LDES_server).

TODO

- Select the appropriate views and fragmentations for publishing
- TODO: What does the LDES Server do (only makes fragmentations)
